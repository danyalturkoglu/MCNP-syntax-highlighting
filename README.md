# MCNP-syntax-highlighting

This syntax highlighting is for the Sublime Text 3.  

Instructions:
1. Install Sublime Text 3 (the software is "free", but it's worth supporting the developers)
2. Open Sublime Text 3.
3. In the menu, navigate to Tools --> Developer --> New syntax...
4. Erase the contents of the file that opens up.  
5. Copy and paste the contents of mcnp.sublime-syntax into it the file.
6. Save it as mcnp.sublime-syntax with an extension type of YAML.  
7. Files containing the "--Begin Cells--", "--Begin Surfaces--" and "--Begin Options--" and that end with .inp and .i extensions should have the syntax highlighting.  
8. As a test, open syntax_text.inp.  If the file is plain text, make sure that the file type is "mcnp" in the lower right corner.  If it is not, click on the language and select "mcnp"
